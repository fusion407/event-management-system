# Event Management System

This is a full stack application project I have created with Ruby on Rails and ReactJS.

## Usage

Users may sign up, and log in to accounts with secure - encrypted passwords.

Once logged in, users may be able to create events, view events created by others, edit, and register events they wish to attend.

When a user registers for an event, the registration info will be displayed in the profile page where the user can un-register events, or change the amount of partcipants they wish to include.
